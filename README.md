The program works by allowing instructors to create a lab login system for their classes in order to track how many hours a user spends working in the lab. The program contains a login system for both students and instructors, as well as an administrator. Administrators are able to create and delete labs as well as manage instructors' and students' system information. Instructors can view student hours spent in their respective courses.
